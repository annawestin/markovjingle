Jesus no crying he makes
last night
Eskimos
bed
he lay
so snowy white
and some
are lowing the baby awakes
and mistletoe
looked down where he lay
a peep
jolly Christmas
beard so snowy white
plan on me
Santa
```

```
holly jolly Christmas
Santa Claus last night
walk down the street
up like Eskimos
bright
you meet
a turkey and some
open fire
I was tucked
crying he makes
eyes all aglow
awakes
are lowing the baby awakes
year
```
